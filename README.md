# UnityWordGames

I recently just published my first Unity book, focusing on Word Games. The book is called, appropriately, [**Word Games With Unity**](https://www.amazon.com/Word-Games-Unity-Roger-Engelbert-ebook/dp/B0796DNB6G/), and covers everything one needs to know to build some of the most popular word games out there, and put any idea for a new word game puzzle to the test.

The book has 4 different game tutorials, plus tutorials on how to manage word lists and how to solve grids.

The book is available at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Word-Games-Unity-Roger-Engelbert-ebook/dp/B0796DNB6G/) and [iBooks](http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/isbn9781912084364).
